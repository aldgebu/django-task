This project was developed in 24 hours as part of a coding challenge.
As a Flask developer building my first Django project, I did my best to write clean and maintainable code using the concepts I understand deeply.

My goal was to implement everything thoughtfully and avoid rushing through parts I wasnâ€™t confident in. As a result, the project may not be fully complete, but it reflects my genuine effort and learning process within the limited time.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
